Save your first article
=======================

The main purpose of wallabag is to save web articles. You have many ways to do it.

.. note::

    A quickstart will be displayed in the application until you save your first article.

By using a bookmarklet
----------------------

On the ``Howto`` page, you have a ``Bookmarklet`` tab. Drag and drop the ``bag it!`` link to your bookmarks bar of your browser.

Now, each time you're reading an article on the web and you want to save it, click on the ``bag it!`` link in your bookmarks bar. The article is saved.

By using the classic form
-------------------------

In the top bar of your screen, you have 3 icons. With the first one, a plus sign, you can easily save a new article.
